So you are a comitter and you want to release a new version of Seccubus.

# Calculate a new version number

As of April 2016 the "odd" version numbers are development releases the "even" version are releases.

So if 2.20 is the current release then 2.21 is the release currently under development. It will become 2.22 as soon as you will release it.

# Update SeccubusV2.pm

In SeccubusV2.pm there is a line like this:

```
$VERSION = '2.21';
```

Update it to reflect the new version number.

# Make sure README.md and ChangeLog.md are up to date

Make sure that README.md reflects all changes since the last released version, Make sure that you copy this to the head of ChangeLog.md as well. It has all the changes since version 2.0.alpha1

# Make sure that all unit tests pass

Check [![CircleCI build status](https://circleci.com/gh/seccubus/seccubus/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/seccubus/seccubus/tree/master) 

This ensures that the packes build on all supported platforms too.
